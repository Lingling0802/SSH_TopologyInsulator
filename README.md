# SSH_TopologyInsulator

A model for two-dimensional electronic, photonic, and mechanical metamaterial systems is presented, which has flat one-dimensional zero-mode energy bands 
and stable localized states of a topological origin confined within twin boundaries, antiphase boundaries, and at open edges. 
Topological origins of these flatbands are analyzed for an electronic system as a specific example, using a two-dimensional extension of the 
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Hamiltonian with alternating shift of the chains. 

It is demonstrated that the slow group velocities of the localized flat band states are sensitively controlled by the distance between 
the boundaries and the propagation can be guided through designed paths of these boundaries.
